# BA780-Project-US-and-Japan-YouTube-Trending-Videos
Our goal is to analyze US and Japan YouTube trending videos and identify preferences in video categories, channels, publishing and trending time and viewer interactions. We will analyze the characteristics including categories, view, likes count and trending time (season/weekday/month), in trending videos to identify and compare changes in preference over time. Moreover, we are interested to know if the country culture has an influence on the YouTube trending videos characteristics.
